# NIST

The NIST utility is used for functionality based around NIST DB Queries, and is primarily used to create URLs for the API based queries.

In order to use the URLs generated by `netutils.nist.get_nist_urls*`, you will need an api key provided by NIST [here]('https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key').  This key will need to be passed in as an additional header in your request in the form of `{"apiKey": "<key_value>"}` as stated by NIST in their [Getting Started]('https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/start-here') section.

The NIST utility can be used as a standalone module to create generic and defined custom NIST URLs as seen below:
```python
from nist import get_nist_url_funcs

# Generic URLs only require vendor, os_type, and version_string
generic = get_nist_url_funcs['default']({"vendor": "Cisco", "os_type": "IOS", "version_string": "15.5"})
# ['https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?virtualMatchString=cpe:2.3:o:Cisco:IOS:15.5:*']

# Custom URL builds require a more defined dictionary.
# See the documentation on platform_mapper.os_platform_object_builder, it may be more useful.
juniper_junos = get_nist_url_funcs['juniper']['junos']({'isservice': False, 'ismaintenance': False, 'isfrs': True, 'isspecial': False, 'service': None, 'service_build': None, 'service_respin': None, 'main': '12', 'minor': '4', 'type': 'R', 'build': None})
# ['https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0?virtualMatchString=cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.4r:*:*:*:*:*:*:*']
``` 

Current OS/Other Platform types that require a custom NIST URL:

- Juniper JunOS
